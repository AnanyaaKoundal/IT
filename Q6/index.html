    <p id="text">Twenty-five hours had passed since the incident. It seemed to be a lot longer than that. That
        twenty-five hours seemed more like a week in her mind. The fact that she still was having trouble comprehending
        exactly what took place wasn't helping the matter. She thought if she could just get a little rest the entire
        incident might make a little more sense.</p>
